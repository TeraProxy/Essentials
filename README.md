##### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Status :heavy_exclamation_mark:
Should work on all regions as long as the opcodes are mapped. Works on Caali's and Pinkie Pie's tera-proxy.

##### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Installation :heavy_exclamation_mark:
1) Download Essentials: https://github.com/TeraProxy/Essentials/archive/master.zip
2) Extract the contents of the zip file into "\tera-proxy\mods\"
3) Done! (the module will auto-update on Caali's proxy when a new version is released)
  
Users of Pinkie's proxy also need to install tera-game-state: https://github.com/caali-hackerman/tera-game-state/archive/master.zip

# Essentials
A tera-proxy module that automatically uses "Nostrum"/"Battle Solution" and "Complete Crystalbind" items whenever needed.

## Usage
There are several options you can change in the config.json file (Pinkie's proxy: "\settings\Essentials.json"):  
  
* "useNostrum" - Change this to "false" if you do not want the module to use any Nostrums
* "useCCB" - Change this to "false" if you do not want the module to use any CCBs
* "nostrumTime" - When to use Nostrum (in minutes left)
* "CCBTime" - When to use Complete Crystal Bind (in minutes left)
* "dungeonOnly" - Change this to "true" if you want the items to be only used in dungeons
* "log" - If you need to find a specific item ID, change this to "true" and it will log the ID of any item you use in the proxy chat
* "nostrum" - This is the ID of the Nostrum item the module will use.
* "ccb" - This is the ID of the Nostrum item the module will use
  
While in game, open a proxy chat session by typing "/proxy" or "/8" in chat and hitting the space bar.  
This serves as the script's command interface.  
The following commands are supported:  
  
* **essentials** - enable/disable Essentials
* **essentials dungeon** - switch between using items everywhere or only in dungeons

## Safety
Whatever you send to the proxy chat in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.  
The script makes sure that you are not dead, mounted, in a battleground or in a negotiation before using an item.  
The script will disable itself when you run out of items to use.
