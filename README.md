##### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Status :heavy_exclamation_mark:
Should work on all regions as long as the opcodes are mapped but I personally only test modules on NA with Caali's tera-proxy: https://discord.gg/maqBmJV  

##### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Installation for Caali's tera-proxy :heavy_exclamation_mark:
1) Download Essentials: https://github.com/TeraProxy/Essentials/archive/master.zip
2) Extract the contents of the zip file into "\tera-proxy\bin\node_modules\"
3) Done! (the module will auto-update when a new version is released)

# Essentials
A tera-proxy module that automatically uses the items "Elite Everful Nostrum" and "Complete Crystal Bind" whenever needed.  

## Usage
If you don't have Elite/Club status, you can open up "config_1-3-6.json" and change "elite" from true to false in order to use Prime Battle Solution instead of Everful Nostrum.  
You can change the used non-Elite/Club items by editing the item IDs for "ccb" and "nostrum" in "config_1-3-6.json".  
  
While in game, open a proxy chat session by typing "/proxy" or "/8" in chat and hitting the space bar.  
This serves as the script's command interface.  
The following commands are supported:  
  
* essentials - enable/disable Essentials

## Safety
Whatever you send to the proxy chat in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.  
The script makes sure that you are not dead, mounted, in a battleground or in a negotiation before using an item.
