# Essentials
A tera-proxy module that automatically uses the items "Elite Everful Nostrum" and "Complete Crystal Bind" whenever needed.  
  
## Usage  
If you are playing on a non-NA server, you need to replace "ITEMS_NOSTRUM" in "index.js" with the matching item id.  
  
While in game, open a proxy chat session by typing "/proxy" or "/8" in chat and hitting the space bar.  
This serves as the script's command interface.  
The following commands are supported:  
  
* essentials - enable/disable Essentials  
  
## Safety
Whatever you send to the proxy chat in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.  
The script makes sure that you are not dead, mounted, in a battleground or in a negotiation before using an item.
